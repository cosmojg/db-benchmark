new issue

attach a database

run query

during query execution, size of attached database doesn't grow as expected (stays at 12KB).


Temporary files are created for the initial persistent database.
These files do not get deleted. 

If I try to run the query again and write to a different database/ or drop the database the query gets killed.




-- semi anti. In order to make the plan and create the join condition, you will need to use both bindings. 

One option is to just project the left (so insert some other projection)

I think you have to push a dummy subquery operator that selects only objects from the left table.
